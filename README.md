# Outfit-Check
The premier fashion skill to balance your color palette and avoid disaster.

## What it does
Outfit Check, powered by Amazon Alexa, will assist you in finding a fashionable outfit perfect for the current season

## How we built it
We used the Amazon Alexa developer SDK, passing user input about their outfit thoughts to a Lambda function, which replies to the user with opinions and suggestions

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge was connecting the Alexa skillset to AWS Lambda

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud that we completed our project, that it's working smoothly, and that it is in production available as an Alexa skill

## What we learned
We learned a lot about AWS and serverless execution, and that we should always start by producing a functional version of the minimum viable product before attempting to develop the advanced features of an application

## What's next for Outfit Check
In the future, outfit check will be able to judge your outfit based on a picture of it, and will also know about special colors for holidays
